This repository contains various projects around the shifters on the Waho KICKR indoor bike.

The aim is to provide sufficient information so that..
- anyone can build their own custom shifters - maybe you have a physical disability that makes standard shifters hard to use, or maybe you would just like to have tri-bar shifters on your bike.
- anyone can repair their shifters, once they are out of warranty or have been damaged in a way that voids the warranty.
- anyone can interface their bike's shifters to another device, promoting recycling and reuse of technology, once it reaches the end of its useful life.

If you have any feedback or ideas, or spot any errors, please contact me, preferably by creating an issue.

I take no responsibility for any damage that arises to your KICKR Bike, due to any errors in the information I have offered. Please verify any wiring, such as power supply polarity and pinouts as you go along - that's what I did. If you spot anything that is incorrect, please let me know.
